# personalwebsite


I developed this personal website to showcase my skills and experience as a front-end web developer.

This website can also serve as a CV and it includes my contact info and portfolio.

Built with React JS, SCSS, and Bootstrap, my website features dynamic typing effects using Typed JS library and gradient colors from WebGradients. 

I also used Formspree service to operate the contact form. 

Please note: The loading screen loads in 1 second on purpose.

Check it out to learn more about my experience and projects.
